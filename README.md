# Directed Weighted Graph in python
### Project Overview

- This Project was build for Ariel University Object Oriented Course

- In this project we were to rebuild the same Directed Weighted Graph but in python instead of java, and add a new method of where we compute
the graph strong connected components

- In the next step we were suppose to compare our implementation performance vs NetworkX and Java implementation  

- you can see the results in the sections on this [wiki](https://github.com/miko-t/Ex3_OPP/wiki/Comparison-between-the-implementations)

- Learn how to use our graph here [wiki](https://github.com/miko-t/Ex3_OPP/wiki/How-to-use)

## Overview
- We implement the interface **GraphAlgoInterface.py** and **GraphInterface.py**, as the files **GraphAlgo.py** and **DiGraph.py**

- Adding the ability to plot graph, calculate Strongly connected components, and Shortest path

- Comparing the graph performance vs NetworkX library and The java implementation from Ex2, look for performance overview tab to see more.
